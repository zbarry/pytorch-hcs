# convit-hcs-moa-prediction

Prediction of drug mechanism-of-action (MoA) from high content screening images.

## Background

![](https://data.broadinstitute.org/bbbc/BBBC021/aurora-kinase-inhibitor.png)

Example image from [BBBC021](https://bbbc.broadinstitute.org/BBBC021) dataset
used in this work.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/zbarry/pytorch-hcs.git
```

2. Install the environment and the `pytorch_hcs` package:

```
cd pytorch-hcs
conda install -c conda-forge mamba -y
mamba env update
```

(the `mamba` install is optional but recommended as a conda replacement)

This will create a `pytorch-hcs` environment and `pip install` the Python package in one go.

3. Acquire the BBBC021 dataset

In a notebook or Python terminal, run the following:

```python

```
